# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
- A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- This game allows two players to play against each other in a browser.
## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for the structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and making the game visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Used for the game logic, including handling player turns, checking for winners, and resetting the game.
## Game Logic
- A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If the grid is full and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
